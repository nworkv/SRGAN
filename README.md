## just custom trained SRGAN
A project dedicated to the study of the architecture of a SRGAN. 
A detailed description of the model's intricacies can be found in the article [Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial
Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802#page=10&zoom=100,66,644)
